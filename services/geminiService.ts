- CLOTHING: Keep original clothing/accessories unchanged (salon cape, neck band, etc.)
- ANGLE: Preserve the same camera angle and perspective - do not change viewing angle

FACIAL TRANSFORMATION ONLY:
- Change only the facial features to match the requested style
- Keep identical lighting, shadows, and background
- Maintain same head positioning and pose

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Photorealistic result with natural facial proportions
- Zero changes to non-facial elements
- Exact preservation of pose and angle
